### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a computer scientist studying for a master's degree at UFMG. I'm passionate about data science and machine learning.

### During my undergraduate journey, I focused on statistics for data science and explored various machine learning algorithms, uncovering their applications in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, and reinforcement learning.

### My current research involves fine-tuning a Large Language Model to perform a specific information retrieval task. Fingers crossed for its success! ðŸ¤ž
